    <h2>Risk Warning</h2>
    <p>
      Investing in new companies has risks. You might find it hard to quickly turn your investment into cash, with no
      regular dividends, a chance of losing what you put in, and your ownership getting smaller. If you're going for
      this, mix it up with other investments. Ata Plus is for folks who understand these risks and can make their own
      choices. Check out the full Risk Warning for a complete picture of these risks.
